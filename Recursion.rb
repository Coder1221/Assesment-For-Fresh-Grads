# Write a recursive algorithm to reverse a string and remove all vowel letters during recursion.

# Function should take one string as input
# Example: 
    # Input -> "abcdefghi"
    # Output -> "hgfdcb"

    # Input -> "aeiowqu"
    # Output -> "qw"




# Write a recursive algorihum to find average of list

# Function should take one list as argument

# Example 
    # Input -> [2,3,4,5,1]
    # Output -> 3
