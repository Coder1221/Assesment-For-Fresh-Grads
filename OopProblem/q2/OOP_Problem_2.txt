Design a customer class that should be used in a project that system plus client will use in his next startup.
For simplicity the client wants a ruby native class.
Requirments are given below:
    It should have following fields: name , customer_unique_id , phone_number ,email , address  , payment_status(success,failed)
    We need a function upon calling that function it returns the data of all customers.
    If we provide data in csv(comma seprated) file . it should be able to import that data in to your class.
    A function which should return the count of success and failed payments. (This function will be most frequently called)
    A function which should return all those customers who have payment_status as success
    Except unique id we can update any field of the customer.
    Two customers cannot have same phone number or email.

Use Object oriented programming paradigm to solve this problem.
Your solution will be judged based on decision choices and data structures you chooze to solve this problem.
Best of luck.
Happy Coding.
