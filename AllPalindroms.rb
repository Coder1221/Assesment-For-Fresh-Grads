# Write a function to get all palindroms in string. 

# A plaindorm is a string if we reverse that string it would remain same.
# like level ,madam ,ada ,


# Minimum length of palindrom should be greater than equal to 2.


# Examples:
    #Input "level"
    #Output ["level" ,"eve"]

    # Input "zxz"
    # Output ["zxz"]

    # Input "abcreferdeff"
    # Output ["refer" , "efe" ,"ff"]
