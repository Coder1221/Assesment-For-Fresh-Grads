# Write a sort function to sort the following string. You are not allowed to use any builtin sort function that are provided by language libraries. 

# You have to sort the string first according to digits and then according to alphabetical order.

# Write your own sort function that you think that  it will be suitable in case of this type of data.


# Example
    # Input  "0a12b3c4e5r"
    # Output "012345abcer"
    
    # Input  "998800zzccxxxaaa"
    # Output "008899aaaccxxxzz"

# String can be much longer like this
# 8923092103912391923120931209031923019230192039120391203912039120312093
# 012930sadksnakjdnasjkdlasndlkjsandlajsdnlasjdnlkjsnldkjasdjasldkasjdnla
# jsdasdnasdaksdasndkanl

# So write the sort function which is more suitable for this type of requirement and will be faster.

# Also write your reasoning why you are choosing certain algorithum. And write the time and space complexity
