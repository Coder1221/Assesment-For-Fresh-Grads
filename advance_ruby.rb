# write a function to sort the list of number in decreasing order (use ruby builtin sort function)

# Solve these set of questions using ruby higher order functions that are ruby builtin

# 1) Write a function which takes sum of only even numbers in a list and return that sum.


# 2) Write a function that square of the number when it is even . take the cube root of the digit when it is odd and then take the sum.
# Function will return one scalar value(single value)

# Examples:
    # Input [2,3,4]  
    # Output should be 29(2^2 + 3^3 + 4^2 = 4 + 9 + 16 = 29) 


# 3)write a function to find the frequency of characters in a string
    # Input "aabccc"
    # output {"a"=>2 , "b"=>1 , "c"=>3}
